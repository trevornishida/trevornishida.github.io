title: Hawaii County Data Dashboard
---

This is a prototype dashboard I created for Hawai’i county as a project for ART475, Data Visualization. The dashboard was written in R, mainly using the “shiny” and “shinydashboard” libraries. 
Using various data provided by the county, I was able to create a user friendly interface which will help to organize and visualize all of their data. There is also an interactive map using the “leaflet” package which displays key areas for tourism on Hawai’i island. This project took about 8 weeks to complete.
