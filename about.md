  <p align="right"> I was born and raised on the island of Oʻahu in the state of Hawaiʻi. I graduated from the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo in Spring of 2023, with a major in <b>Marine Science</b>, a minor in <b>Chemistry</b>, and a certificate in <i>Data Science</i>.
  <br>
  <br>
In the future I would like to research <br>
    the morphological plasticity <br> 
    of coral reefs and how <br>
    this morphological plasticity <br>
    affects coral reef ecosystems <br>
    and the coral microbiome. 
  <br>
  <br>
I am also interested in the applications of various data science tools, namely machine learning and AI vision, as a way to further augment my research capabilities.</p>
