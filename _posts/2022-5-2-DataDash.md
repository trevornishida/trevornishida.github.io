title: Hawaii County Data Dashboard
---

This is a prototype dashboard I created for Hawaii county as a project for ART475, Data Visualization. The dashboard was written in R, mainly using the `shiny` and `shinydashboard` libraries. 
Using various data provided by the county, I was able to create a user friendly interface which will help to organize and visualize all of their data. There is also an interactive map built using the `leaflet` library which displays key areas for tourism on Hawaii island. This project took about 8 weeks to complete.
