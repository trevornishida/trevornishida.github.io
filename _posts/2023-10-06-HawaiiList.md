title: Hawaii Marine Fauna List
---

Over the summer of 2023, I was lucky to be selected as a [NOAA Pacific Islands Science Center Young Scientist Opportunity Intern](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/outreach-and-education/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center-young-scientist-opportunity). PYSO Intern for short. 


Working under Dr. Jonathan Whitney, Dr. Jamison Gove and Andrea Schmidt; I worked to support analysis of large amounts of eDNA data collected during a cruise to assess biodiversity of shallow-water coral reefs in West Hawaii. 
Over the course of my internship, I was tasked to compile a number of sources to create a list of Marine Fauna localized to the Hawaii Exclusive Economic Zone. 
The goal of this list was to create the first *(that we were aware of)* comprehensive list of marine fauna so we could have a sort of check-list for use in verification of data.
Data were pulled in from a number of sources including the Bishop Museum, Invert-E-Base, Ocean Biodiversity Information System, Lifewatch, as well as various experts in their respective fields.
Most of the analysis was completed in R, with a large helping hand from the World Registry of Marine Species database. 
Data and code used for analysis can be found on [this](https://github.com/trevornishida/HawaiiMarineFauna) GitHub repository as well with some notes about the approach to processing data and additional information.
