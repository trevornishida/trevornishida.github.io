I was born and raised on the island of Oʻahu in the state of Hawaiʻi. I am currently studying at the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo, with a major in **Marine Science**, a minor in **Chemistry** and certificates in the *Marine Option Program* and *Data Science*.

In the future I would like to research the morphological plasticity of coral reefs and how this morphological plasticity can effect coral reef communities and the coral microbiome. 

I am also interested in the applications of various data science tools, namely machine learning and AI vision, as a way to further augment my research capabilities.
